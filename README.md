### 🛒 E-Commerce SaaS Product - $30k+ Acquisition
**Cash-on-Delivery Shopify App** (Delivered December 2024)

**The Problem:** Latin American merchants losing customers at checkout due to poor COD payment support in Shopify - critical for region where COD dominates e-commerce.

**What I Did:**
- **Led 9-person engineering team** (2 technical leads + 7 developers)
- Architected full-stack Shopify app with regional payment processor integration
- Built merchant dashboard for COD order management and tracking
- Implemented webhook system for real-time order status updates

**The Outcome:** Acquired by 3 major e-commerce influencers for **$30,000+ USD** in December 2024

**My Role:** Technical leadership, architecture, team coordination, client communication, product delivery

### 🎉 Event Management Platform (Delivered March 2025)
**High-End Event Production Dashboard for Brazilian Entertainment Industry**

**The Origin:** COVID-19 devastated Rio's entertainment industry. Watched friends shut down due to manual processes, poor communication, and zero real-time profitability visibility.

**What I Built:**
- **Led 4-person team** building dual-platform system
- Consumer app: AI-powered event discovery with curated listings
- Producer dashboard: Real-time analytics, VIP guest management, instant profitability tracking
- AI-assisted event planning and customer LTV tracking across events
- Multi-role access control (producers, promoters, operations staff)

**Current Status:** Delivered to Rio event agency with **54 team members enrolled**, pending production rollout

**The Impact:** Producers now see profitability **during events**, not days later

### 🎯 FocusGuard - AI-Powered Productivity Extension (July 2025)
**Chrome Extension with 83 Active Users**

**The Problem (My Own):** Managing 8 productivity apps was creating more work than actual productivity. 47 tabs open, context-switching constantly, busy but not productive.

**What I Built:**
- Led 2-person team building all-in-one productivity Chrome extension
- Website blocking, goal/task tracking, integrated calendar, world clock
- **AI goal-alignment analysis** - checks if daily work actually moves toward stated goals
- Published on Chrome Web Store with freemium model

**The Differentiator:** AI tells you when you're busy but not productive (uncomfortable, but honest)
